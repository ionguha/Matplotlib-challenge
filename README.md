**_Pymaceuticals Inc._**, a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based in San Diego, specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. Recently, the company began screening for potential treatments for **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**, a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.  
In their most recent animal study, **_250 mice_** identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of the study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, **Capomulin**, versus the other treatment regimens.
